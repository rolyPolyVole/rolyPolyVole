`\*\*\* About me - Last updated 05/04/2024 \*\*\*`
Hello! I'm a proficient JavaScript, TypeScript and Java developer, and a Minecraft and Chess enthusiast.\n
I learnt JavaScript and its typed variant coding bots on discord. I'm a professional at making them now, I even take commissions for custom bots!\n
I picked up Java while creating Minecraft plugins. I'm working on a Minecraft network as a project right now. It's not complete enough right now, but when it is I will be looking for collabs!

If you're suffering from daily developer burnout, friend me on Chess.com for a chill round of chess!
