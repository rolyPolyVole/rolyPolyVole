Hello!<br>
💻 I'm a proficient **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **Java** developer, and a **Minecraft** and **Chess** enthusiast.<br>
<br>
🎓I learnt JavaScript and its typed variant coding **bots** on discord. I'm a professional at making them now.<br>
🪙 I even take commissions for custom bots!<br>
<br>
I picked up Java while creating **Minecraft plugins**. I'm working on a **Minecraft network** as a project right<br>
now. It's not complete enough yet, but when it is I will be looking for 🤝 **collabs**!<br>
<br>
☠️ If you're suffering from daily developer burnout, friend me on [chess.com](https://chess.com) for a chill round of chess!  <br>
